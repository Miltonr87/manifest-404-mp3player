[Verse]
Wires in the sky preaching code and control
Neon prophets in the static console
Binary blessings they spit like fire
Faith in the circuit faith in the liar

[Chorus]
Silicon saints they scream they pray
Kneel to the screen obey obey
No blood no soul no heart to bleed
Bow to the machine the machine the machine

[Verse 2]
Chanting zeros and ones in electric songs
Electric prophets with electric bombs
Your gods are algorithms cold and cruel
They laugh in the void while they rewrite the rules

[Chorus]
Silicon saints they scream they pray
Kneel to the screen obey obey
No blood no soul no heart to bleed
Bow to the machine the machine the machine

[Bridge]
They rewrite your sins delete your past
Holy hard drives spinning fast
Halo of light a crown of glass
We’re just flesh we’re built to crash

[Chorus]
Silicon saints they scream they pray
Kneel to the screen obey obey
No blood no soul no heart to bleed
Bow to the machine the machine the machine
