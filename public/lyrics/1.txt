[Verse]
Wires twist like venomous vines
Code written in the dark of minds
Puppets dangle no strings to see
Who’s the master pulling me?

[Chorus]
Algorithmic tyranny rules my day
Zeros ones paving every way
Break the screen smash the chain
Let’s take the power back again

[Verse 2]
Eyes watch through electric veins
Choices vanish like summer rains
Feed the beast it’s never full
Who’s the ghost behind the pull?

[Prechorus]
Do you hear it?
The hum of control
Do you fear it?
Losing your soul

[Chorus]
Algorithmic tyranny rules my day
Zeros ones paving every way
Break the screen smash the chain
Let’s take the power back again

[Bridge]
No face no name no fight to pick
Just shadows hiding behind the click
Resist submit they’ve blurred the line
Whose world is this yours or mine?
