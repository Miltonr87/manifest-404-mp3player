[Verse]
Wires tangled like my brain
Code on the screen drives me insane
Coffee stains and endless nights
Fingers twitch in electric fights

[Chorus]
Code revolution rise tonight
Break the system take the fight
1s and 0s we ignite
Code revolution burn so bright

[Verse 2]
Eyes bloodshot but I don’t care
Algorithms fill the air
Binary dreams in a broken land
Typing freedom with my hands

[Prechorus]
No more rules no more chains
Rip the leash rewrite the game

[Chorus]
Code revolution rise tonight
Break the system take the fight
1s and 0s we ignite
Code revolution burn so bright

[Bridge]
Hack the grid flip the switch
Glitch the power make it twitch
We’re the ghosts of the machine
Freedom’s code is in our genes
