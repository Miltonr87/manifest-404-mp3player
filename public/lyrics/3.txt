[Verse]
Your face flickers on the screen
Pixelated dream
Can't touch can't feel can't scream
The silence burns me down
Miles apart but you're so loud
The only thing I know right now

[Prechorus]
Are you real are you there
Or just static in the air

[Chorus]
I wanna break the glass
Wanna shatter the wires
Reach through the static
Burn through the fire
This pixelated love
Ain't enough ain't enough ain't enough

[Verse 2]
Fingers trace the glowing keys
You're so close but youâ€™re not with me
Electric ghosts where love should be
Eyes locked but out of touch
Screens can't hold this kind of rush
This distance cuts like broken trust

[Prechorus]
Can we break can we bend
Will this nightmare ever end

[Chorus]
I wanna break the glass
Wanna shatter the wires
Reach through the static
Burn through the fire
This pixelated love
Ain't enough ain't enough ain't enough
