[Verse]
Plastic veins pulse
Neon blood runs
Chasing the high under flickering suns
Electric whispers
They crawl through my head
Wires and circuits where my soul should've bled

[Chorus]
Synthetic addiction
It’s eating me whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole

[Verse 2]
Metallic taste
It clings to my tongue
Promises of power
Where lies are sung
Plug me in deeper
Drown out the pain
Binary fever
I’m a ghost in the mainframe
[Prechorus]
I’m not alive
I’m not dead
I’m a shadow
A code instead

[Chorus]
Synthetic addiction
It’s eating me whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole

[Bridge]
Zeros and ones are my new bloodstreams
A nightmare dressed in electric dreams
Rip me out
Tear me free
But I’m chained to this machine

[Chorus]
Synthetic addiction
It’s eating me whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole
Synthetic affliction
It’s stealing my soul
One more hit
One more glitch
I’m losing control
Synthetic addiction
I’m not even whole
I’m not even whole

[Bridge]
Zeros and ones are my new bloodstreams
A nightmare dressed in electric dreams
Rip me out
Tear me free
But I’m chained to this machine
