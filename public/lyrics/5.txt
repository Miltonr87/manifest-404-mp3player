[Verse]
Click click scroll repeat
Wires in veins hearts obsolete
Eyes glazed over dreams in retreat

Lost in the glow they can't escape
Screens like chains
Digital tape
Freedom buried in a silicon grave

[Chorus]
Break the firewall tear it down
Burn it to ash on this hollow ground
Scream out loud can you hear the sound?
Break the firewall break the firewall now

[Verse 2]
They trade their souls for likes and views
Plastic minds with nothing to lose
Reality's fake in their chosen ruse

No fire no fight no blood in their veins
Cogs in the wheel of the tech domain
Blind to the truth as they rot in chains

[Chorus]
Break the firewall tear it down
Burn it to ash on this hollow ground
Scream out loud can you hear the sound?
Break the firewall break the firewall now
